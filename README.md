<h1>Wireshark Fundamentals</h1>
An overview of Wireshark and its uses 

<br />
<br />

<h2>Basics</h2>

- <b>What it does : Wireshark captures network traffic and presents it in a form of individual packets for closer inspection<b>
- <b>Packet (network frame) : A piece of data sent over a network and contains different headers which the type, source and destination IP, and protocol<b>

<h2>Uses</h2>

- <b>Analyze previously captured traffic stored in PCAP files for threat identification<b>
- <b>Identify when a packet was sent along with the details of its process<b>
- <b>Can pinpoint the time and type of attack and IP addresses targeted<b>

<h2>Features</h2>

- <b>Live traffic/packet capture<b>
- <b>Packet dissection<b>
- <b>Ability to search and filter for packets<b>
- <b>Customize and color code packets<b>

<h2>PCAP (Packet Capture) Files</h2>

- <b>An API used to capture/record network packets from layer 2-7 of OSI model<b>
- <b>Wireshark uses .pcap files to capture/store packets for analysis<b>
- <b>Traffic captured with Wireshark can be im/exported in a .pcap file<b>
- <b>Analysts can import and analyze network traffic captured on a different network and different time<b>
